# PyQueryGen

## What is PyQueryGen
A simple, and easy to use program to quickly write SQL scripts from a .CSV file. The .CSV file should be modified **ahead of time** so that the data is ready to be imported, updated, deleted, etc... This program is not for **modifying** database data, simply for building the scripts to enter, update, delete, etc. data from the database.
